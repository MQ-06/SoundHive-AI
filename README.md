# 🐝 Bee Colony Health Monitoring

An ML-based system to monitor and classify bee colony health states using audio analysis. This project uses deep learning to detect various hive conditions including healthy states, swarming behavior, queenless colonies, and disease indicators.

## 🎯 Project Overview

Bee populations are declining globally, threatening agriculture and ecosystems. This project aims to help beekeepers monitor hive health through automated audio analysis, enabling early detection of problems and timely interventions.

### Key Features
- Multi-class classification of hive health states
- Real-time audio analysis
- Spectrogram-based deep learning models
- Edge device deployment capability (Raspberry Pi)
- Comprehensive evaluation and explainability
